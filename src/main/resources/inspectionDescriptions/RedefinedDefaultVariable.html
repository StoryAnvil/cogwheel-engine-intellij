CogScript has variables that are predefined in every script. These variables called <a href="https://storyanvil.github.io/wiki/wiki.html?p=wiki/projects/cogwheel/defaultvariables">default variables</a>.
Redefining them can cause confusing because it is usually expected to have these variables in every script.

Example:
</p>
<pre><code>
# Check contents of 'Cogwheel' variable (this is first line of script)
# Line below will log "Cogwheel Object" to console because it contains CogMaster object (see Cogwheel Engine's wiki for more info).
Cogwheel.log(Cogwheel)

# Redefine the 'Cogwheel' variable
Cogwheel = true
Cogwheel.log(Cogwheel)
# Line above will log "TRUE" to console because we redefined the 'Cogwheel' variable
</code></pre>
